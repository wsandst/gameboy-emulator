//! blip_buf is a small waveform synthesis library meant for use in classic video game
//! sound chip emulation. It greatly simplifies sound chip emulation code by handling
//! all the details of resampling. The emulator merely sets the input clock rate and output
//! sample rate, adds waveforms by specifying the clock times where their amplitude changes,
//! then reads the resulting output samples.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * Several code examples, including simple sound chip emulator.
//! * Uses fast, high-quality band-limited resampling algorithm ([BLEP]).
//! * Output is low-pass and high-pass filtered and clamped to 16-bit range.
//! * Supports mono, stereo, and multi-channel synthesis.
//!
//! # Based upon
//!
//! This library is a very thin wrapper on the original C library, found here: https://code.google.com/p/blip-buf/
//!
