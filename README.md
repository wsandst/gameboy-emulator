# gameboy-emulator
Gameboy Emulator written in Rust. Uses SDL2 for graphics and input. 
Currently only the CPU is implemented.
## Todo:
- [x] General CPU Instructions
- [X] Automatic blargg testing
- [X] CPU Interrupts
- [X] General CPU Cycle Timings
- [ ] Memory cycle accuracy
- [ ] Pass all blargg tests
- [ ] GPU
- [ ] I/O

## CPU Tests
Passing blargg cpu_instrs and instr_timing. Large refactor needed to pass mem_timing.
